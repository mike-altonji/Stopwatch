# Stopwatch

A stopwatch app where the user can press anywhere on the screen to start/stop the timer. The reset button floats at the bottom.
Ideal for sprints, where attention to detail on locating the start/stop buttons is difficult in-the-moment.
Really just for myself, since I want to see how fast I can run a 40-yard dash!
